# Final Exam

Modules

1. Data structures
3. Parallel programming
4. GUIs
5. Alternative programming paradigms

Combine at least two modules in a single project. Project ideas:

### Data Structures and Parallel Programming: High-Performance Data Processing System

Develop a system that utilizes advanced data structures to efficiently process large datasets in parallel. This project can explore the use of trees, graphs, or custom data structures optimized for parallel processing on multi-core systems or GPUs.

### Networking and User Interfaces: Collaborative Real-Time Data Visualization Tool

Create a web-based tool that allows users to collaboratively visualize and manipulate large datasets in real time. This project would combine networking to manage real-time data transmission between users and user interface design for creating intuitive and responsive data visualization tools.

### Parallel Programming and Reactive Programming: Distributed Stream Processing Framework

Design a framework that leverages reactive programming principles to handle stream processing in a distributed, parallel environment. This could be particularly useful for real-time analytics in scenarios like financial markets, social media trend analysis, or IoT sensor data processing.

### Data Structures and Functional Programming: Immutable Data Structure Library

Develop a comprehensive library of immutable data structures using functional programming principles. This project focuses on creating efficient, thread-safe data structures that are essential in concurrent programming.

### User Interfaces and Alternative Programming Paradigms (Logic Programming): Intelligent UI Design Assistant

Create an intelligent tool that assists in UI design by using logic programming to understand user requirements and generate UI mockups. This project can explore how alternative programming paradigms like logic programming can be applied to create intuitive and adaptive user interfaces. 

### Networking and Data Structures: Optimized Network Routing Algorithm Simulator

Build a simulator for testing and analyzing network routing algorithms. This project would involve using advanced data structures to efficiently model network topologies and simulate various routing algorithms under different conditions.

### Parallel Programming and Networking: High-Speed Network Traffic Analyzer

Develop a tool that uses parallel programming techniques to analyze high-speed network traffic in real time. This project could explore methods for efficiently processing and visualizing large amounts of network data using parallel computation.
