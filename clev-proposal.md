# Visualizing Paxos

The Paxos algorithm is a consensus protocol that ensures multiple distributed CPUs and/or GPUâ€™s agree on a single value, even in the event of failures. The system achieves fault tolerance by reaching majority agreement across proposers, acceptors, and learners, ensuring consistency and safety without relying on a central authority. Paxos operates by introducing a thorough process of proposing, voting, and committing, where proposals must gain majority approval to become the agreed value. Its design addresses the challenges of network delays, message loss, and partial failures, making it a foundational algorithm in distributed systems despite its complexity.

I propose a project that helps visualize the Paxos algorithm by using Python GUI libraries. Using frameworks like tkinter or PyQt, one can simulate the roles of proposers, acceptors, and learners, allowing users to observe how proposals flow and reach consensus. A dynamic interface with real-time animations can highlight key phases, such as proposal generation, voting, and quorum formation. Ideally, this iterative and interactive approach will help explain the complexities of this consensus algorithm in a unique way. 

**Action Items**:
- Implement Paxos logic using three different objects: Proposers, Acceptor, and Learner. 
- Unit test the Paxos logic:set fileencoding?
- Decide which GUI framework is best to visualize the algorithm depending on algorithm implementation
- Fully Implement GUI backbone
- Unit test GUI backbone
- Fully integrate Paxos logic into GUI backbone
- Unit test integrated framework
- Implement real-time user interaction (e.g. insert live proposals, sudden crash)
- Establish rigorous exception handling and sanitizing mechanisms for the user input
